TaxCloud.js
===========

We have a new JavaScript library for anyone who needs to calculate sales tax and prefers to work with JavaScript on the client side. We call it ‘TaxCloud.js’ and you can use it purely as a library of TaxCloud-specific API calls, or as a very simple UI shopping cart to collect items and determine sales tax due (based upon your customer’s address) before you send a total purchase amount to your purchasing platform.

Thank you!
